//! Pack runtime core for Greentic runner.
//!
//! This crate provides the building blocks required to ingest pack indexes,
//! download pack artifacts from multiple backends, verify their integrity, and
//! maintain an on-disk cache that other runtimes can consume. It is not meant
//! to be embedded directly; use `greentic-runner`/`greentic-runner-host`, which
//! wrap these helpers with the canonical runtime.
