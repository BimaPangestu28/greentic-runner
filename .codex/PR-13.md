# Title: Remove legacy provider execution code paths (post-switch cleanup)

## Preconditions
- PR-08 merged and enforced in CI
- PR-12 merged (legacy WIT removed) or runner no longer depends on it

## Goal
Delete dead code paths and configs that supported legacy typed provider protocol execution.

## Tasks
1. **Remove legacy dispatch**
   - Delete modules that instantiate legacy provider worlds
   - Remove adapter logic
2. **Config cleanup**
   - Remove legacy flags except:
     - keep `GREENTIC_PROVIDER_CORE_ONLY=1` as the permanent default (or remove flag entirely and make it always-on)
3. **Docs**
   - Document provider invocation as provider-core only
4. **Tests**
   - Ensure all tests still pass and coverage remains for provider-core

## Acceptance criteria
- Only provider-core execution exists.
- Codebase simpler; fewer branches; fewer bugs.
