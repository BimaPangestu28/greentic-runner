# Runner Vision

This folder defines the canonical documentation direction for `greentic-runner`.

- Canonical model: `docs/vision/canonical-v0.6.md`
- Deprecation signals: `docs/vision/deprecations.md`
- Legacy guidance: `docs/vision/legacy.md`

Rule of thumb: if a document conflicts with canonical v0.6 guidance, follow `canonical-v0.6.md` and treat older docs as historical reference.
